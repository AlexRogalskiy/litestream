## Open-source, not open-contribution

[Similar to SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html), Litestream is open
source but closed to contributions. This keeps the code base free of proprietary
or licensed code but it also helps me continue to maintain and build Litestream.

As the author of [BoltDB](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt), I found that
accepting and maintaining third party patches contributed to my burn out and
I eventually archived the project. Writing databases & low-level replication
tools involves nuance and simple one line changes can have profound and
unexpected changes in correctness and performance. Small contributions
typically required hours of my time to properly test and validate them.

I am grateful for community involvement, bug reports, & feature requests. I do
not wish to come off as anything but welcoming, however, I've
made the decision to keep this project closed to contributions for my own
mental health and long term viability of the project.
